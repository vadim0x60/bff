# Cibi

[Cibi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cibi) is a war dance that Fijian rugby team performs before it gets into a [scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(rugby)) and defeats its opponents.

This package doesn't perform any war dances (yet), but it can defeat most [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environments using:

- [Neural Program Synthesis with Priority Queue Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03526)
- Principles of [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-framework-poster)
- A slightly extended version of [Brainfuck language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
- [Action stacks](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2689/action-queue)
